This is my personal RTS game project, for this project my goal is to make a "command and conquer" esque Real-time strategy game all on my own. This project is a showcase of my code using game AI, systems and more.


As of sunday the 8th of December 2024 this repository is open-source, because I think this project could be a great portfolio piece!

There's one little thing with this project; I used a bought plugin called "Favorites-Tab" from the asset store, and I tried my best to entirely remove any reference to it in the repository using BFG cleaner.
If at anyone ever discovers a way that people could use my repository to get their hands on this useful tool without paying to the original creator, message me and I'll private this repository again.
